    Gib is a creative interactive installation project about small, absurd data. Gib is the reversal of "big", because the piece focuses on small data, as opposed to big data. I hope that through the interaction between the audience and the installation, participants can pay more attention to the small data around them, so that they are willing to explore and share tiny personal metrics which allow them to connect and laugh with each other.  Use of Gib, a playful nonsense machine,  contrasts with the secretive and negative effects of big data, which collect and sell our information for profit while threatening our privacy and security.
