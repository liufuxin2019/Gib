  <h1 style="text-align: left"> Before talking about small data, let's first talk about someting else --</h1>
  <h2>Big data</h2><br/>
  <p style="font-size: 16px">Nowadays, many businessmen and scholars always talk about how much value big data can bring, or how much convenience it brings to our lives. 
  <br/><br/>
  <h2>What is small data?</h2><br/><br/>
<p style="font-size: 16px">With the development of science and technology, we are using more and more technological products in our daily lives. People use mobile phones to make calls, use the Internet to search for the knowledge they need or other content, use tablets to process work, use wearable devices to record their own health data, and use smart furniture to control home appliances. When these electronic devices work, they will record the user's habits and preferences, analyze and organize them into a user group, and some will upload these data to the online cloud, which will generate more economic value under the analysis of commercial companies. <br/><br/>
Recently, more and more things in our lives are connected to the Internet: mobile phones, transportation tickets, cars, smart homes ... and these devices are subtly learning our living habits, analyzing our hobbies and recording our status. Although we are often ignorant of this, we are always producing data, and let data change our lives.
